## WebApp Workflow

1. **🧭User Onboarding & Trip Planning
Users begin by signing up, selecting an avatar, and customizing preferences with the help of an AI travel assistant. After logging in, they choose a city and specify how many people are joining the trip. The app then helps them plan the journey, including travel dates and must-visit places.**  
2. **🚌Transport & Reward Redemption
To reduce traffic and promote eco-travel, users are encouraged to book public transport via the app. They are directed to the public transport website and, upon successful booking, receive rewards. These earned coins can be used later to redeem special offers or benefits within the app.**  
3. **📸 3. Task Engagement & Emergency Support
As users explore new places, they are encouraged to complete tasks like clicking photos and learning about the location's history, precautions, and restrictions. A dedicated SOS button is available for safety emergencies. Upon completing tasks, users earn rewards, promoting interactive and safe tourism while incentivizing participation through redeemable coins.**
4. **🌟Next Step Selection (Eat, Rest, Travel More)
After completing a location or activity, the user is guided to choose their next action. The app provides suggestions like nearby cafés to eat, hotels to rest, or additional attractions to explore. This feature ensures a smooth transition between activities and helps users make the most of their journey based on their current needs and preferences.**
